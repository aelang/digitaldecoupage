The handmade scrapbooks of ephemera by Scottish poet Edwin Morgan (1920-2010), held at the University of Glasgow, are an extraordinary treasure-trove of insights into not only the development of one of the most significant of twentieth-century Scottish poets, but also a wide variety of social and political issues, discourses of national identity, and practices of media consumption and curation at a time of considerable social and technological change. However, access to the scrapbooks is limited due to the fragility of their material construction, and also because of the tens of thousands of clippings from which they are constituted, many are of unknown provenance and might potentially breach copyright were they to be digitised and made available online. 

This project seeks to construct, and theorise, a digital prototype which will make certain core aspects of the Morgan notebooks available online, for instance the visual layout of the pages, the networked quality of the images, the range of topics covered, the materiality of pages in which layers of paper have been glued or folded over other layers, and more. Methods from computer science which have in recent years been gaining traction within the digital humanities-for instance topic modelling and the automated recognition of images by machine learning-will be used in order to identify patterns and relationships that would be difficult or impossible for a human reader to discern, and the prototype will use the affordances of digital media to represent these in ways that go beyond the mimetic.
