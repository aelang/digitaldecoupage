+ What productive possibilities for reproducing and remediating cultural objects arise when we move beyond the notion of digitised facsimiles and instead focus on the specific affordances of digital media? 

+ How can digital media and their associated methods of meaning-making be deployed in the service of representing the specificity of print-based ephemera? And how do users make sense of, and respond to, such digital remediations of cultural objects?

+ What interpretative possibilities are offered by algorithmic transformations of textual, semantic, visual and structural elements of cultural objects for which straightforward digitisation is not possible? And how might libraries and archives make use of these possibilities in the effort to preserve their collections, adhere to copyright regulations, and make their holdings as widely accessible as possible?
